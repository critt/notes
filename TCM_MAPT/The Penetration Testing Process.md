1. Reconnaissance
	1. Active: Interacting with the target in some way
	2. Passive: Researching the target using a priori information about it
2. Scanning: Using tools that actually touch the target's physical or digital infrastructure to enumerate open ports, running applications and services, operating system and software versions etc
3. Exploitation: Taking advantage of the vulnerabilities discovered in the above steps
4. Privilege Escalation: Once inside a system or environment, moving laterally or vertically to obtain more access
	1. Lateral: from device or app to another device or app as the same user
	2. Vertical: from one user account to another user account with (ideally) more privileges
5. Covering your Tracks
	1. Eliminating evidence that may incriminate you, or leave signs of exploitation
	2. Changing timestamps, erasing video footage, etc.
6. Reporting: Documenting and presenting all of your findings in report form
